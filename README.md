dotenv: For handling environment variables.
langchain-core: For managing messages, prompt templates, and other elements of the conversation flow.
langchain-community: For SQL database utilities.
langchain-groq: For integration with the ChatGroq model.
streamlit: For building the web user interface.

langchain_core.output_parsers: Used to parse text outputs.
langchain_groq: Provides specific functionalities to interact with the ChatGroq model.
streamlit: Used to build the interactive web interface.
After installing these libraries, you should be able to run the code without issues, as long as all other components (such as models and the database) are correctly set up and accessible.

Add your keys in the .env file and install the libraries
